    "description": "\u201cFiona Liv opens the night with an hour of original songs that can be felt as a dim orange glow, for the listener with a sensitive ear this orange may turn to purple, maybe even into a fiery crimson, or the blue of a cloudless sky. That is to say that these songs are musically diverse and colorful, they show us the power of simplicity.After Fiona, Stryder jones takes the stage, using his original production to propel the listener into a vivid world, this world may be familiar, and at other times it may be alien, but it does not lack detail, and if the ears are not fully taken, then Stryder\u2019s dance moves may awaken your interest, these dance moves are improvised, and highly energetic, they are a manifestation of music through the entire body. In such a setting as Trident this performance will be highly personal, and engaging.The night closes with a 30-minute live animation on Stryder\u2019s personal dream machine (IPad) Stryder will start with a blank white screen, and start drawing a moving scene, look for Stryder_Jones_ on TikTok to see more original animations. This live animation will be underscored by Stryder\u2019s latest full length album, \u201cDreams\u201d an electronic trance album that will bring the listener towards a state of heightened imagination and relaxation. This album is psychedelic, it was made with a great amount of research and fascination, most of these songs were made in one sitting, with his eyes closed and his hands racing along his keyboard.\u201d",

    "description": "Singer-songwriter Carson O'Keeffe seeks to speak to something unsung in everyone through radically vulnerable\u00a0songwriting and raw, emotive performances as Lonely Whale. Hauntingly honest songs meditate on the bittersweet nature of life; the beauty and the brevity of existence. A hypnotherapist by day, Carson's lyrics also explore themes of trauma, individuation, spirituality, and loneliness. Carson shares her unique voice in the hopes of providing solidarity and comfort for those experiencing life at the same frequency.\u00a0With an intimate and nostalgic sound reminiscent of the 90s, Lonely Whale's songs are often soft and lulling with peaks that become bold, brash, and wailing. Fans have likened Lonely Whale's sound to Mazzy Star, Modest Mouse, Cat Power, Joanna Newsom, Bright Eyes, and Sufjan Stevens. Carson's debut studio album, a concept album titled In the Cave, was released in 2019 and is available for streaming on any platform. Get lost in a whirlwind of sounds and emotions that offer reprieve from the loneliness of the everyday, and be less lonely with\u00a0Lonely Whale.",

    "description": "This fall, Smithsonian Books publishedOn a Mission: The Smithsonian History of US Women Astronauts,a can\u2019t-miss book for space lovers that celebrates three generations of US women astronauts, including the challenges they\u2019ve faced and the significant contributions they\u2019ve made.Boulder resident Valerie Neal, curator emerita from the Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum and expert on human spaceflight, interviewed many of the US women astronauts to bring their experiences to life. Profiles of all NASA\u2019s spacefaring women highlight their individual and collective achievements across almost 50 years.Sally Ride became a household name as the first American woman in space, but scores of equally impressive women have also left their mark in space. On a Mission: The Smithsonian History of US Women Astronauts spans 45 years and 61 astronauts to share the epic journeys of women who made space for themselves in a male-dominated field.Valerie Neal, emerita curator in the Department of Space History at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, offers a culturally insightful history of the experiences of women astronauts, the challenges they've faced, and their distinctive stories. Collectively, they've completed more than 100 space shuttle missions and more than 30 long-duration stays on the International Space Station and Russian Space Station Mir, and they continue to prove themselves in present-day space exploration efforts.The book includes 50 black-and-white photographs to complement the historical account. With its sweeping look from the first women astronauts to Christina Hammock Koch, assigned to the first crewed Artemis mission around the Moon, there is no comparably thorough book on America's women astronauts. On a Mission is an inspiring tribute to unsung women's history.VALERIE NEAL is a curator emerita in the Department of Space History at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, where she oversaw the human spaceflight collections from the space shuttle and International Space Station programs, and she initiated the collection of artifacts from women astronauts. Her previous books include Discovery: Champion of the Space Shuttle Fleet and Spaceflight in the Shuttle Era and Beyond.",

    "description": "Author of the popular\u00a0New York Times\u00a0articles \"Is It a Crush or Have You Fallen Into Limerence?\" and \"Does My Virginity Have a Shelf Life?\" Amanda McCracken shares her honest, funny, and at times heartbreaking story of learning how to seek true love and intimacy.Journalist and late-in-life virgin Amanda McCracken dated over 100 men by the time she was in her late thirties. She was so certain she was doing everything she could to find the loving, lasting relationship she wanted. So why wasn\u2019t it working? After another breakdown in her therapist\u2019s office, she came to a startling realization: she was addicted to longing.This realization was part of a 10-year journey to understand the cultural, neurological, and psychological factors that shaped her beliefs about love, sex, and commitment. She began to understand that longing for someone feels good. It can even feel better than being in a secure relationship. Longing can provide a sense of control when life is uncertain and offers a safe place to hide from emotional vulnerability, especially in today\u2019s online dating and hookup world. But longing can trigger an addictive neurochemical boost that can derail us from forming healthy, intimate relationships.In this searingly honest book, Amanda shares the crushes, relationships, situationships, travel, friendships, hookups, bad dates, wins, losses, and brushes with fate that came with her journey.\u00a0 Starting with her early childhood hero fantasies and how they evolved in her tween and teen years into a commitment to the purity movement espoused at her church, she chronicles her profound longing for love that led her to her lowest point. She provides a deep, exploratory look into the state of mind known as limerence: an obsessive rumination on an idealized version of someone. Amanda weaves together her personal journey with research, storytelling, soul-searching questions, and quotes from experts and nonexperts alike to reveal the addictive nature of longing while providing hope through her journey of breaking her patterns and ultimately choosing the path towards healthy, authentic intimacy.Amanda McCracken is a journalist passionate about experiences that highlight the intersection of wellness, travel, and relationships. Her work has appeared in The New York Times, Washington Post, Guardian, Vogue, National Geographic, Elle, NPR, Outside, ESPN, SELF, Runner\u2019s World, and many others. She published her first article about longing in 2013, which led to additional articles featuring personal anecdotes and deep research and interviews with the BBC and Katie Couric. She is now considered a \u201climerence expert\u201d and intimacy advocate. Her 2023 TED Talk, \u201cHow Longing Keeps Us From Healthy Relationships,\u201d and her podcast, The Longing Lab, highlight how longing can become self sabotaging and shares how to change our patterns of longing. McCracken is also a part-time university instructor, massage therapist, triathlon coach, and competitive athlete. Raised in Cincinnati, Ohio, McCracken put down roots with her husband and daughter in Boulder, Colorado, after a trip around the world aboard the Peace Boat.",

    "description": "Salads and Sunbeams is a psych-pop group based in Denver, Colorado. Salads\u2019 primary singer/songwriter, Nathan Brazil, started the band in 2014 as an outlet for the simplistic, poppy, retro songs that didn\u2019t quite fit with the bands he was involved in at the time. Members have come and gone, though Denver music fixture and Brazil\u2019s longtime collaborator, Suzi Allegra, has been involved with nearly everything the group has done.The first incarnation of the group released a self-titled EP in 2014 with little fanfare, though it was very good and captures the original, sloppy/poppy thrust of the group. Shortly thereafter, life intervened. The death of someone close to Brazil and a shared desire for change and growth scattered the group across the country and the world. After the shakeup, as the world slowly came back into focus, Brazil headed to the basement and recorded another Salads and Sunbeams album, Tintinnabulation, almost entirely on his own, though with notable additions from Allegra. This new album sprawled beyond simple pop to encompass ambient pieces, covers of Victorian comic-opera, the use of a professional string quartet, synthesizers, and general experimentation.Very proud of the album, Brazil released it digitally in early 2020, just in time for the Covid pandemic to eclipse and redefine its relevance.Returning to Denver in late 2021, Brazil reconnected with Suzi Allegra and the larger Denver music scene and restarted the group as a live project, writing and rehearsing new material in addition to previously unperformed material from Tintinnabulation.The new group made its debut at Down In Denver 2022 and continues to play shows in and around Denver. Their new full-length album, Into the Starless Night was released March, 18 2025.\u200bThe current lineup is: Nathan Brazil (guitar/keys/vocals), Suzi Allegra (bass/keys/vocals), Justin Drummond (drums), and Eric Thompson (guitar/keys)",

While working as the executive director of Brightline Defense, a San Francisco\u2013based environmental justice nonprofit, he was inducted into the State of California\u2019s Clean Energy Hall of Fame for his work in equity and clean energy. In addition to his nonprofit work, he has served as president of the San Francisco Commission on the Environment as well as a commissioner on the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and Bay Conservation and Development Commission. He is a self-taught artist who has been recognized as a Cartoonist-in-Residence by the Charles M. Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa.About Advocate:\u201cAdvocate,\u201d ISBN 9781984862495, a graphic memoir published by Penguin Random House/Ten Speed GraphicBorn in the United States to Korean immigrants, Eddie grew up working at his family\u2019s store with the weighty expectations that their sacrifices would be paid off when he achieved the \u201cAmerican Dream.\u201d Years later after moving to San Francisco and earning a coveted law degree, he then does the unthinkable: he rejects a lucrative legal career to enter the nonprofit world.In carving his own path, Eddie defies his family\u2019s notions of economic success, igniting a struggle between family expectations, professional goals, and dreams of community. As an environmental justice attorney, he confronts the most immediate issues the country is facing today, from the devastating effects of wildfires to economic inequality, all while combatting burnout and racial prejudice. In coming fully into his own, Eddie also reaches a hand back to his parents, showing them the value of a life of service rather than one spent only seeking monetary wealth.Weaving together humorous anecdotes with moments of victory and hope, this powerful, deeply contemplative full-color graphic novel explores the relationship between immigration and activism, opportunity and obligation, and familial duty and community service.",
